MP3::Tag.pm
===========

* It seems that to allow intelligent handling of Unicode file names we need to keep a non-decoded name (e.g., from readdir())
  and a decoded one (to extract the info from the file name).  Should not we expect that new() may be called with an unicode name???

    What is below is not 100% clear now :-[

* perhaps restructuring of this wrapper module, as it 
  should be easier to say which Tag::modules should be used

  Arguments in handlers

  Direct handlers through __handler_read, __handler_write().  (To avoid security risks, writing-when-read-is-assumed etc.)
  	Possibly needed on ID3v1/ID3v2 only (others cannot write yet).
  Take into account that title() etc take arguments (write!).
  	Be draconian when rejecting method calls; allow slack via config.
  Allow Packages=*, pass through config.
  Allow passing through field().

  ID3v2::get_frame has wantarray(), but only in one place!

* more testing

MP3::Tag::ID3v1.pm
==================

* more testing



MP3::Tag::ID3v2.pm
==================

* Encryption of frames (read and write)

* Only first tag in front of file is read, tags inside mp3-data are ignored

* Following frames are only supported in RAW mode:
  - EQUA -> Equalization
  - ETCO -> Event timing codes
  - MLLT -> MPEG location lookup table
  - POSS -> Position synchronisation frame
  - SYLT -> Synchronized tempo codes
  - RVAD -> Relative volume adjustment

* more testing

* reading of frames is very strict following rules of ID3v2 definition, but
  a lot of programs seem to do this not, so some frames are not read right
  (eg TMED of contains 'DIG, MD' instead of '(DIG/MD)', but only
  '(DIG/MD)' is returned correctly as 'Other Digital Media, MiniDisc'
  'DIG, MD' is returned as 'DIG, MD'

* frames like TMED who have to be specially encoded, are doing this only
  when the frame is read, not when it is written 

* Support for v2.4 output (is input fully supported now?)
